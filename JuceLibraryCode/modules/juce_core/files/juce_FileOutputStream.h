        created or opened (for example, because the parent directory of the file
        does not exist), the failedToOpen() method will return true.

        If the file already exists when opened, the stream's write-position will
        be set to the end of the file. To overwrite an existing file,
        use File::deleteFile() before opening the stream, or use setPosition(0)
        after it's opened (although this won't truncate the file).

        Destroying a FileOutputStream object does not force the operating system
        to write the buffered data to disk immediately. If this is required you
        should call flush() before triggering the destructor.
