    Used by container classes as an indirect way to delete an object of a
    particular type.

    The generic implementation of this class simply calls 'delete', but you can
    create a specialised version of it for a particular class if you need to
    delete that type of object in a more appropriate way.

        // but not defined). This is a problem because then the following delete is
        // undefined behaviour. The purpose of the sizeof is to capture this situation.

        // implementation of all methods trying to use the ScopedPointer (e.g. the destructor
        // of the class owning it) into cpp files where they can see to the definition
        // of ObjectType. This should fix the error.
